# Introduction

**lockc** is open source software for providing MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
type of security audit for container workloads.

The main reason why **lockc** exists is that **containers do not contain**.
Containers are not as secure and isolated as VMs. By default, they expose
a lot of information about host OS and provide ways to "break out" from the
container. **lockc** aims to provide more isolation to containers and make them
more secure.

The [Containers do not contain](containers-do-not-contain.md) documentation
section explains why we mean by that phrase and what kind of behavior we want
to restrict with **lockc**.

The main technology behind lockc is [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) - to be more
precise, its ability to attach to [LSM hooks](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/bpf_lsm.html)

Please note that currently lockc is an experimental project, not meant for
production environments. Currently we don't publish any official binaries or
packages to use, except of a Rust crate. Currently the most convenient way
to use it is to use the source code and follow the guide.
